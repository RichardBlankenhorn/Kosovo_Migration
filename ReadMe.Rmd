## Objective

The goal of this analysis is to provide evidence in favor of or against the argument that the NATO bombing campaign caused a large number of individuals to flee their homes and country. The data sets used in this analysis were obtained from the HRDAG website at https://hrdag.org/kosovo-data/. The data consists of several migration data sets along, NATO airstrike activity, KLA activity and pcodes for the various municipalities.
